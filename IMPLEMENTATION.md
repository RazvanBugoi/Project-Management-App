Okay, here is a comprehensive plan that you can hand off to your developer to get them started immediately. It's broken down into discrete phases with clear instructions and incorporates all our discussions and refinements.

**Project: Project & Quote Management Application**

**Goal:** Develop an MVP web application to replace the current Excel-based system for managing projects, applications, quotes, consultants, and tasks.

**Timeline:** 10 days (Ambitious)

**Technology Stack:**

*   **Frontend:** React (with a component library like Material UI or Ant Design)
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js (REST API)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Hosting:** Heroku (or similar, for MVP deployment)

**Phase 1: Project Setup, Database, and Core Entities (Days 1-2)**

**Objectives:**

*   Set up the project structure for frontend, backend, and database.
*   Design and implement the complete database schema.
*   Create basic API endpoints for `Projects`.

**Tasks:**

1. **Project Initialization:**
    *   Create a Git repository for the project.
    *   Set up the backend directory:
        *   Initialize a Node.js project (`npm init`).
        *   Install necessary packages: `express`, `pg` (for PostgreSQL), `dotenv` (for environment variables), `bcrypt` (for password hashing).
    *   Set up the frontend directory:
        *   Create a React app using `create-react-app`.
        *   Install a component library (e.g., `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`).
2. **Database Design & Implementation:**
    *   Create the database in PostgreSQL.
    *   Create the following tables based on the agreed-upon structure (see "Database Schema" below). Ensure proper data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.
    *   Consider adding `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps to relevant tables for auditing purposes.
3. **Backend: API Endpoints for Projects:**
    *   Create a `models` directory in the backend to define database interaction logic.
    *   Create a `controllers` directory to handle API request logic.
    *   Create a `routes` directory to define API routes.
    *   Implement the following API endpoints for `Projects`:
        *   `GET /projects`: Get all projects (filtered by archived status if needed).
        *   `GET /projects/:projectCode`: Get a specific project by its code.
        *   `POST /projects`: Create a new project.
            *   Validate that the `Project Code` is unique and in the correct format (XXXX).
        *   `PUT /projects/:projectCode`: Update an existing project.
        *   `PATCH /projects/:projectCode`: Update the `Archived` status of a project.

**Phase 3: Instructions, File Uploads, and UI Enhancements (Days 5-6)**

**Objectives:**

*   Implement the `Instructions` creation logic.
*   Set up file uploads for `Quote PDF`.
*   Build basic UI components for managing `Applications` and `Quotes`.

**Tasks:**

1. **Backend: API Endpoint for Instructions:**
    *   Implement `POST /quotes/:id/instruct` endpoint to create an `Instruction` when a quote is marked as "Instructed."
        *   This should create a new record in the `Instructions` table, linked to the `Quote ID`.
        *   Update `Time to Deliver` field in the `Instructions` table once the `Work Delivered` is updated to true and the `Date Work Delivered` is filled.
    *   Implement `GET /quotes/:id/instructions` endpoint to get `Instructions` by `Quote ID`
    *   Implement `PUT /quotes/:id/instructions` endpoint to update the instruction related fields in the `Instructions` table.
2. **Backend: File Uploads:**
    *   Choose a file storage solution (e.g., store files locally on the server or use cloud storage like AWS S3, which is recommended for scalability).
    *   Install necessary packages for file upload handling (e.g., `multer` for local storage).
    *   Implement an API endpoint to handle `Quote PDF` uploads.
        *   Store the file path or URL in the `Quote PDF` field of the `Quotes` table.
3. **Frontend: UI for Applications:**

    *   Implement file upload functionality for `Quote PDF`.

**Phase 4: Consultants, Topic Areas, Tasks, Authentication, and Authorization (Days 7-8)**

**Objectives:**

*   Implement API endpoints for `Consultants`, `Consultancy`, `Topic Areas`, and `Tasks`.
*   Implement user authentication and authorization.

**Tasks:**

1. **Backend: API Endpoints for Consultants & Consultancy:**
    *   Implement CRUD endpoints for `Consultants` and `Consultancy`. Ensure you can link consultants to a consultancy.
2. **Backend: API Endpoints for Topic Areas:**
    *   Implement CRUD endpoints for `Topic Areas`.
3. **Backend: API Endpoints for Tasks:**
    *   Implement CRUD endpoints for `Tasks`.
    *   Allow tasks to be linked to either a `Project` or an `Application` (consider a polymorphic relationship if your database supports it).
4. **Backend: User Authentication:**
    *   Create API endpoints for user registration (`POST /register`) and login (`POST /login`).
    *   Hash passwords using `bcrypt` before storing them in the database.
    *   Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Upon successful login, issue a JWT to the client.
    *   Implement middleware to protect API routes, verifying the JWT for authenticated requests.
5. **Backend: User Authorization:**
    *   Add a `Role` field to the `Users` table (Admin/User).
    *   Implement authorization logic in relevant API endpoints to restrict access based on user roles. For example, only admins should be able to create tasks.
6. **Frontend: Authentication:**
    *   Create login and registration pages/components.
    *   Store the JWT received from the backend (e.g., in local storage) and send it in the headers of subsequent API requests.

**Phase 5: UI for Remaining Entities, Reporting, Testing, and Deployment (Days 9-10)**

**Objectives:**

*   Build UI components for `Consultants`, `Consultancy`, `Topic Areas`, and `Tasks`.
*   Implement basic reporting functionality.
*   Thoroughly test the application.
*   Deploy the application to Heroku (or a similar platform).

**Tasks:**

1. **Frontend: UI for Consultants & Consultancy:**
    *   Create pages/components for managing consultants and consultancies.
    *   Implement list views and forms for creating, editing, and deleting.
2. **Frontend: UI for Topic Areas:**
    *   Create a page/component for managing topic areas.
    *   Implement a list view and forms for creating, editing, and deleting.
3. **Frontend: UI for Tasks:**
    *   Create a `Tasks` page/component.
    *   Implement a list view to display tasks (with filtering by project or application).
    *   Implement a form to create new tasks (only accessible to admin users).
    *   Implement functionality for users to comment on tasks and update their status.
4. **Frontend: Basic Reporting:**
    *   Create a report generation feature (e.g., a button on the `Projects` page) that fetches quotes related to a project and generates a CSV file for download.
    *   You can also explore basic PDF generation using a library like `jsPDF` if time permits.
5. **Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for backend API endpoints.
    *   Write integration tests to test the interaction between different parts of the application.
    *   Perform thorough manual testing of all features, including different user roles and edge cases.
6. **Deployment:**
    *   Set up a Heroku account (or a similar platform).
    *   Configure your application for deployment (e.g., set up environment variables, database connection).
    *   Deploy the backend and frontend to Heroku.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling throughout the application, both in the frontend and backend. Provide informative error messages to the user.
*   **Input Validation:** Validate user inputs on both the frontend and backend to prevent invalid data from being saved to the database.
*   **Security:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
*   **Code Style:** Follow consistent code style and formatting throughout the project. Use a linter to enforce code style rules.
*   **Documentation:** Write clear and concise code comments to explain complex logic. Generate API documentation using a tool like Swagger/OpenAPI if possible.

This comprehensive plan provides a solid roadmap for your developer. Remember that communication is key! Encourage your developer to ask questions, provide feedback, and suggest improvements throughout the development process. Good luck!
