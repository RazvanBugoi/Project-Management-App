# Testing Methodology

## Overview
The application uses Jest as the testing framework with a focus on unit and integration testing. Tests are organized by model/component and follow a consistent pattern to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Test Structure

### Model Tests
Each model has its own test file in `backend/tests/models/` following these patterns:

1. **CRUD Operations**
   - Create: Test successful creation and validation errors
   - Read: Test retrieval of single and multiple records
   - Update: Test successful updates and constraint violations
   - Delete: Test deletion and referential integrity

2. **Validation Tests**
   - Required fields
   - Format constraints
   - Unique constraints
   - Foreign key constraints

3. **Business Logic Tests**
   - Status transitions
   - Conditional validations
   - Computed fields

### Test Setup
- Each test suite uses its own isolated database context
- Tables are cleaned before each test
- Foreign key relationships are handled in correct order
- Environment variables are properly configured for testing
