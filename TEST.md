## Failing Test

The following test is currently failing:

File: `frontend/src/pages/Projects.test.jsx`
Test: "navigates to edit project page when edit button is clicked"

Error message:
```
TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find an element by: [data-testid="edit-button"]
```

## Attempted Solutions

1. Using `getByRole`:
   - Attempted to find the edit button using `screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Edit' })`
   - Result: Failed to find the button

2. Using `getByLabelText`:
   - Attempted to find the edit button using `screen.getByLabelText('Edit')`
   - Result: Failed to find the button

3. Using `getByTestId`:
   - Added a `data-testid="edit-button"` attribute to the edit button in the `DataTable` component
   - Attempted to find the edit button using `screen.getByTestId('edit-button')`
   - Result: Failed to find the button

## Observations

- The edit button seems to be dynamically rendered within the DataGrid component
- The button might not be immediately available when the component is rendered
- The test may need to wait for the DataGrid to fully render before attempting to find the edit button

## Next Steps

1. Investigate the DataGrid rendering process and see if there's a way to wait for it to fully render
2. Check if the edit button is conditionally rendered based on some state or prop
3. Examine the DataTable component to ensure the edit button is being rendered as expected
4. Consider using `findByTestId` instead of `getByTestId` to allow for asynchronous rendering
5. Add more detailed logging or debugging to the test to understand what elements are actually being rendered
